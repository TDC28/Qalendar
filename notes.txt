Figure out a way to make it preferable to keep doing the same thing constantly
i.e. dont do 5 minutes of physics then 5 minutes of math - Try stuff (Quadratic bias)

Setting priority for certain topics (CHEM is hard) (Linear bias)

Ask how many session to user

Limit the time for each subject - user shoudl be able to specify

Set preferences of time (night, after 12:00, within 4-8 pm, etc) 

Option to add breaks between events

End goal - Possibly be able to say: "I don't like this, I want it sooner" and move it sooner
